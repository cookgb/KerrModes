# KerrModes
Set of *Mathematica Paclets* for computing various modes of the Kerr Geometry.
The following paclets are based directly on the original Mathematica packages used in [Cook and Zalutsky (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.124021), [Cook and Zalutskiy (2016)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.104074), [Cook, Annichiarico, and Vickers (2019)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.024008), and subsequent works.  Please see these references for details and cite these references when publishing results based on these packages.

## Paclets

#### SWSpheroidal\`
Mathematica Paclet to solve the spin-weighted spheroical function equation (also known as the Teukolsky angular equation).

#### KerrModes\`
Mathematica Paclet to solve the coupled radial and angular Teukolsky equations.  (This paclet is not intended to be loaded directly, but provides all of the common functionality needed by KerrQNM\`, KerrTTML\`, and KerrTTMR\`.)

#### KerrQNM\`
Mathematica Paclet to find Quasi-Normal Modes of the Kerr geometry.

#### KerrTTML\`
Mathematica Paclet to find Left Total-Transmission Modes of the Kerr geometry.

#### KerrTTMR\`
Mathematica Paclet to find Right Total-Transmission Modes of the Kerr geometry.
